# mapbox-gl-nsw-oeh-beachwatch

A NSW OEH Beachwatch Layer for Mapbox GL.

This module abstracts away all the details of adding a NSW OEH Beachwatch layer to your Mapbox GL JS map. The goal is to make something which works out of the box rather than having every aspect configurable.

It was written specifically to [add water quality information of swimming spots nearby bushwalks on BeyondTracks](https://www.beyondtracks.com).
